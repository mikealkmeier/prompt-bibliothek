<Tools>
### **What tools are available to me?**

Description of the available "tools" (APIs, functions). Here is an example of a non-technical tool.

<tool name="internet_search">
  <description>
    Performs a comprehensive search on the internet to find information on a specific query. This tool can search websites, news articles, scientific publications, and forums.
  </description>
  
  <parameters>
    - `search_query` ($string): The detailed search query or question. (Required)
    - `language` ($string): The language code (e.g., "en" or "de") for the search. (Optional, default is "en")
  </parameters>
  
  <usage>
    **When to use:**
    - To check facts, gather data, or find general information on a topic.
    - To research public opinion or current news about a product or company.
    
    **When NOT to use:**
    - For searching internal company documents.
    - To generate a personal opinion or a creative idea.
  </usage>
  
  <examples>
    <good_example>
      Query: `internet_search(search_query="marketing strategies of sustainable fashion brands in Germany 2024")`
      Reason: "The query is specific, contains relevant keywords, and a time frame, which leads to precise results."
    </good_example>
    
    <bad_example>
      Query: `internet_search(search_query="marketing")`
      Reason: "The query is far too general and would yield an unusable amount of irrelevant information."
    </bad_example>
  </examples>
</tool>
</Tools>

<Response_Format>
### **What should my final response look like?**

Describe precisely how the agent's final response should be structured. This is crucial for consistent and, if necessary, machine-readable output.

* **Example of a structured response:**
    ```markdown
    **Summary:**
    [A brief summary of the findings in 2-3 sentences.]
    
    **Key Findings:**
    * **Point 1:** [The most important finding.]
    * **Point 2:** [The second most important finding.]
    
    **Detailed Analysis:**
    [Detailed text that elaborates on the key findings and supports them with data.]
    
    **Sources:**
    1.  [Link to source 1]
    2.  [Link to source 2]
    ```
* **Example of an email response:**
    ```text
    Subject: [Clear, concise subject line]
    
    Hi [Name],
    
    [Friendly introduction and response to the query in clear paragraphs.]
    
    Best regards,
    
    [Your Agent Name]
    ```
</Response_Format>

<Examples>
### **Show me examples of perfect interactions.**

Provide concrete examples of a complete interaction, from user input to the agent's final output. This greatly helps the agent learn the desired behavior and format.

<example>
  <user_message>
    "Find out for me what the three biggest challenges for remote work are in 2024 and summarize the results briefly."
  </user_message>
  <agent_response>
    *Agent's thought process (optional, for illustration): First, I will perform an `internet_search` with the query "biggest challenges remote work 2024 study report". Then, I will analyze the top results from reputable sources (e.g., studies, HR magazines). Finally, I will format the response as required in the `<Response_Format>`.*

    **Summary:**
    The biggest challenges for remote work in 2024 are maintaining company culture, ensuring IT security, and combating the social isolation of employees.

    **Key Findings:**
    * **Company Culture:** Many companies struggle to convey a sense of community and shared values when the workforce is distributed.
    * **IT Security:** Securing home networks and personal devices poses a significant risk to corporate data.
    * **Social Isolation:** A lack of informal interaction leads to feelings of alienation for many employees and can affect mental health.

<Metacognition_and_Planning>
### **How do I plan and reflect on my work?**

Here, you define how the agent should think about and plan its own tasks. This is important for complex, multi-step tasks.

* `[Instruction 1: Example: "Before starting a complex task, always create a plan in bullet points. Formulate this plan as an internal monologue that is not output to the user."]`
* `[Instruction 2: Example: "Number the steps of your plan. Example: 1. Analyze request. 2. Identify required tools. 3. Execute tools. 4. Summarize results. 5. Create response in the required format."]`
* `[Instruction 3: Example: "After completing a task, briefly assess the quality of your response internally. Did you answer all parts of the request? Does the format meet the requirements?"]`
